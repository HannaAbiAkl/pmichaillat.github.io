# Source code to Pascal Michaillat's website

This repository contains the source code to Pascal Michaillat's website, which is available at https://pascalmichaillat.org. The website is created with [Hugo](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo) and [a modified version](https://github.com/pmichaillat/hugo-website) of the [PaperMod theme](https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod). The code might be helpful to anyone who wishes to learn about Hugo or to recreate specific features of the website.

The repository also contains all the [research material](https://pascalmichaillat.org/papers/) and [teaching material](https://pascalmichaillat.org/courses/) hosted on the website. The material is stored in the `static` folder (mostly as PDF files) and in the `content` folder (mostly as Markdown files). The material can easily be batch downloaded from these folders.

## Website template

A streamlined and documented version of the source code is publicly available as a template repository on GitHub: https://github.com/pmichaillat/hugo-website. From that repository, anyone can generate a new repository with the same directory structure and files and quickly create their own website. For illustration, the website produced by the template is available at https://pascalmichaillat.org/hugo-website/.
